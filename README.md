# Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
The Weather Prediction Project is a machine learning-based solution designed to forecast weather conditions, focusing primarily on predicting average temperatures. Leveraging historical weather data, this project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor model, among other advanced machine learning techniques, to provide accurate and reliable temperature forecasts.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implements comprehensive data cleaning and preparation processes to ensure high-quality input for model training.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Utilizes RandomForestRegressor for forecasting, with infrastructure in place for easy experimentation with other models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for assessing model performance, ensuring predictions are both accurate and practical.
- **Modular Design:** Project structured for easy maintenance and scalability, facilitating enhancements like adding new prediction features or integrating different models.
- **Easy Installation:** Includes a batch file for quick setup of all required libraries, streamlining the initial setup process for all users.
