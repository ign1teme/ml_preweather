# Weather Prediction Project 2.0

## Overview
The Weather Prediction Project 2.0 advances beyond its predecessor by integrating multifactorial forecasting capabilities and optimizing memory usage for efficiency. Retaining its foundation on machine learning and specifically leveraging a Random Forest Regressor, this version broadens the scope of prediction to include various weather conditions, offering more detailed and accurate forecasts. 

## Enhanced Features
- **Multifactorial Prediction**: Now supports predictions based on multiple weather parameters, offering a holistic view of future weather conditions.
- **Memory Optimization**: Improved algorithms for reduced memory consumption without compromising prediction accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Continues to feature comprehensive data cleaning and preparation for high-quality model training inputs.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Besides the RandomForestRegressor, the infrastructure now allows for smoother experimentation with additional predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with enhancements to evaluate the expanded predictive capabilities more effectively.
- **Modular Design and Easy Installation**: Maintains its user-friendly architecture for maintenance, scalability, and straightforward setup.
